Changelog for IoTRack
---------------------

V0.2.0
- First version using the sensors

V0.2.1
- Using persistence for the proximity interrupts
  5 consecutive measurements with a cycle time of 700 ms 

V0.3.0
- switched from ISR to attachInterrupt; this became necessary because
  with "attachInterrupt: Only enabled ports" (which you need when using ISRs)
  all the example scripts for the board crashed. So, you defintely need to set
  attachInterrupt: On all pins, with new implementation"!
  
V0.3.1
- count number of tickets present
- integrate LTE-M sending
- error handling: blink fast
- blink slowly when awake

V0.3.2
- change status LED from D13 to D12 and toggle between input and output (LOW)
- added a check for being in power down mode (in_power_down()) in order to avoid switching
  off the LED after it has been assigned the sleep state value
