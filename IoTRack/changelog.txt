- First version using the sensors

V0.2.1
- Using persistence for the proximity interrupts
  5 consecutive measurements with a cycle time of 700 ms 

V0.3.0
- switched from ISR to attachInterrupt; this became necessary because
  with "attachInterrupt: Only enabled ports" (which you need when using ISRs)
  all the example scripts for the board crashed. So, you defintely need to set
  attachInterrupt: On all pins, with new implementation"!

- error handling: blink fast
- blink slowly when awake
