Changelog for IoTRack
---------------------

V0.2.0
- First version using the sensors

V0.2.1
- CHANGED: Using persistence for the proximity interrupts
  5 consecutive measurements with a cycle time of 700 ms 

V0.3.0
- FIX: switched from ISR to attachInterrupt; this became necessary because
  with "attachInterrupt: Only enabled ports" (which you need when using ISRs)
  all the example scripts for the board crashed. So, you defintely need to set
  attachInterrupt: On all pins, with new implementation"!
  
V0.3.1
- ADDED: count number of tickets present
- ADDED: integrate LTE-M sending
- ADDED: error handling: blink fast
- ADDED: blink slowly when awake

V0.3.2
- CHANGE: change status LED from D13 to D12 and toggle between input and output (LOW)
- FIX: added a check for being in power down mode (in_power_down()) in order to avoid switching
  off the LED after it has been assigned the sleep state value

V0.9.0
- CHANGE: LOC is now the constant that signifies which version of the firmware
  should be generated. In order to have a system that compiles, "example" is
  the default location (with associated server and password in
  web/config/example.conf) and a generated example.h include file.
- CHANGE: The example web page contains now php code
- ADDED: In addition, there is a Wordpress code snippet that can be used to display
  the number of available cards 

V0.9.1
- FIX: switch off LTE when there was an error and we stop.
- FIX: reset globalerror in connectToNetwork only if the error
  was an connection error

V0.9.2
- FIX: Addressed the potential race condition that could result from a hectic user
  who takes out a card (values are changed) and then puts it back. This might
  result in an early interrupt that might go undected and then later events will
  not be registered because the interrupt is edge based.
- FIX: In addition, all interrupt flags are cleared again when verifying the
  initial values. This makes sure that it is impossible to enter sleep state
  with a IRQ line that is low because of an proximity interrupt.

V0.9.3
- ADDED: Print date/time when entering the loop
- CHANGE: Change sleep time to one hour
- CHANGE: Raise sensor error when sensor value is 0
- CHANGE: Changed example.php so that it conforms wit the wordpress code snippet
- ADDED: The code snippet is now also a file in the server folder

V0.9.4
- CHANGED: Changed threshold values to 250/300 so that even black paper is reliably recognized
- There is now a pcb directory in the repo, which contains pcb design data
